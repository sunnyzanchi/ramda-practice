# Ramda Testing
I've used Ramda in some capacity before, but I've never really gotten a chance to really get into it.
This is just some testing I was doing with different methods in the context of data transforms.

## Start
To run, just run
```
npm start
```
Not really a lot to look at, it just logs some lightly transformed data :information_desk_person: :sweat_smile:
