# Ramda Testing
I've used Ramda in some capacity before, but I've never really gotten a chance to really get into it.
This is just some testing I was doing with different methods in the context of data transforms.

## Start
To run, just run
```
npm start
```
Not really a lot to look at, it just logs some lightly transformed data :information_desk_person: :sweat_smile:

## Performance
I knew Ramda would be slower than native functions, I just wanted to see how much slower.
I wrote an implementation using only native JS functionality and it's consistently 10+ times faster than Ramda :weary:
tested in FireFox/Chrome. And, really, I think the complexity is about the same.
So. Probably wouldn't use Ramda where performance counts :confused:
